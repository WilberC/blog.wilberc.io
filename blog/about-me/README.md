description: "Hey there, tech enthusiasts and fellow learners! 👋 I'm Wilber, and this is my cozy corner of the internet
  where I spill the beans on all things tech and my exciting journey through the digital universe.
  So, who am I, you ask? Well, I'm a full stack developer (more focused at backend) 👨‍💻 with passion for creating web
  magic 🧙‍♂️. I've dabbled in everything from Django and RoR to the coolness of React JS or new technologies that caught
  my attention. You name it, I've probably built something with it.
  So, if I have to resume my blog I would say that My blog is your passport to the tech wonderland 🚀✨, where we 
  connect the dots and discover new tech gems. Join me on this thrilling journey of innovation, quality, and endless 
  curiosity. Let's dive into the tech world together! 💻🌟"
